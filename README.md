Scotoma is a wonderful program that allows you to paint your whole screen!:

* Wherever you drag your mouse, a large inky trail will follow it. 
* Don't think you can avoid it by sitting still! Every 5 seconds your mouse isn't moving, you'll be the victim of an ink bomb covering most of your screen.
* That's not it, though. Every 15-30 seconds, your mouse will be dragged to the farthest corner, once again leaving an ink trail across your screen.

To run Scotoma:
* Open the Scotoma application with the eyeball icon.

To end the program:
* press "Ctrl + Alt + Del" 
* This will open up a menu; select "Task Manager"
* Find scotoma in processes, right click on it, and end the program.
