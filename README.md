# Scotoma 

### This is a wonderful program that allows you to paint your whole screen or go partially blind!:

* Wherever you drag your mouse, a large inky trail will follow it. 
* Don't think you can avoid it by sitting still! Every 5 seconds your mouse isn't moving, you'll be the victim of an ink bomb covering most of your screen.
* That's not it, though. Every 15-30 seconds, your mouse will be dragged to the farthest corner, once again leaving an ink trail across your screen.

### To run Scotoma:
#### Either:
 * Open the Scotoma application with the eyeball icon or...
 * run `Scotoma.py` locally
### To end the program:

**1.** press "Ctrl + Shift + Esc"

  * **Alternatively,** use "Ctrl + Alt + Del"

    This will open a menu. Select 'Task Manager'
    
**2.** Find 'Scotoma' in processes

**3.** Right click on it, and end the program.
